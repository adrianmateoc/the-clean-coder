- You have to know how to say no, no matter how much your boss is, you are not obliged to do something.
- Your boss expects his goal to be yours.
- Provide details of things or answer why, it is not always good.

**TEAM PLAY**
- You have to help your colleagues whenever you can or when they are in a bind.

**PASSIVE AGGRESSION**
- Doing nothing can be very harmful for everyone in certain situations.

**CODE IMPOSSIBLE**
- Saying that a code will be ready when it will not be is not going to help at all.
