## ACCEPTANCE TESTING

**COMMUNICATION REQUIREMENTS**
Both sides both employees and employers have to stay in communication to know the needs of the other.

- PREMATURE PRECISION

It is not necessary to give a date but a range of dates, the precision that is requested when setting what is wanted from the project cannot be as much as desired.

- THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE

You have to see things in a working system, since it is not the same as on paper.

- ESTIMATION ANXIETY

Even with perfect information, the estimates will have variations. Keep in mind that estimates are estimates only.

- LATE AMBIGUITY

Try to remove ambiguity from the requirements as much as possible.

**Acceptance Tests**

- THE DEFINITION OF "DONE"

For professionals there is only one definition of something done, and that is that it is completely finished.

- COMMUNICATION

All parts of the project must be clear about what is going to be built.

- AUTOMATION

Acceptance tests have to be automated to save cost.

- EXTRA WORK

Acceptance tests should not be considered extra work, since they consist of saving you time and determining that a job is done or not.

- WHO WRITES ACCEPTANCE TESTS, AND WHEN?

In an ideal world, stakeholders would have to collaborate to write them. They must be done just before implementing the function.

- THE DEVELOPER'S ROLE

This role consists of making the system pass the tests correctly.

- TEST NEGOTIATION AND PASSIVE AGGRESSION

If as a developer there is an incorrect test, you have to let the person in charge know in order to get the best possible software.

- ACCEPTANCE TESTS AND UNIT TESTS

The unit ones are made by programmers for programmers and the acceptance ones are from the company to the company. The purpose of these tests is to formally document the operation of the system.

- GUI AND OTHER COMPLICATIONS

The GUI is difficult to do from the beginning since it is subjective and constantly changing.

- TESTING THROUGH THE RIGHT INTERFACE

Do not use the GUI to do your tests, as it usually gives problems.

- CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION

Every day you have to run the tests in order to fix as many bugs as possible.

- STOP THE PRESSES

The tests must always be working, they must never fail, and if they do, the whole team has to stop what they are doing and give priority to the test.
