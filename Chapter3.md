## SAYING YES

**A LANGUAGE OF COMMITMENT**
- You say you'll do it.
- You mean it.
- You actually do it.

**RECOGNIZING LACK OF COMMITMENT**

Some examples of words and phrases that reveal a lack of commitment:
- Need/Should: "I need to lose weight"
- Hope/Wish: "I hope to get this done by tomorrow"
- Let's: "Let's finish this thing"

**WHAT DOES COMMITMENT SOUND LIKE?**

It is common not to take all the responsibility, but to know that a person is taking all the responsibility, you have to look for sentences that sound like this:
```I will finish this by tuesday```

This sentence only has a binary result, either you do it or you don't.

**IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE I RELY ON PERSON X TO GET THIS DONE**

You can only commit to things you have full control over. But you can commit to specific actions
that will take you to your goal.

**IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW IF IT CAN BE DONE**

If something can't be done, you can still commit to some actions like finding out if it can be done or not.

**IT WOULDN'T WORK BECAUSE SOMETIMES I JUST WON'T MAKE IT**

Something unexpected can happen so that you do not meet the objective. In this case, you have to notify the person with whom you have engaged as soon as possible so that there is any chance that they can help you achieve your goal.

**LEARNING HOW TO SAY "YES"**

A professional is not obliged to always say yes, he is obliged to find ways to make the "yes" possible.
