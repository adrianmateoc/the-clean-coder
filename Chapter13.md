## TEAMS AND PROJECTS

**DOES IT BLEND?**

It makes no sense to tell a programmer to program half the time for project A and the other half for project B.

- The gelled team

A good team is made up of several people, the best figure for a good team is around 12 people, it is usually made up of programmers, analysts, testers and a project manager. It is also usually arranged in a 2:1 format, therefore it would be 7 programmers, 2 analysts, 2 testers and 1 director.

- Fermentation

It takes time for a team to resolve the differences between them and unite with a goal. Once it is achieved, the best idea is to keep the team.

- Which came first, the team or the project?

There is no need to form project teams around a project, professional companies assign projects to already created groups which have good synergy.

- But how do you manage that?

Each team works at a certain speed, which stabilizes over time. If by chance a project is in crisis and this project is in charge of a solid team, it will have more possibilities to carry it forward.

- The project owner dilemma

When you have a solid project team, the project manager can feel a bit left out, since a team which complements each other and has synergies depends less on a manager.
