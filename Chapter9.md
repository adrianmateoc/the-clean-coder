## TIME MANAGEMENT

**Meetings**

1. Time consuming
2. They are necessary

- Declining

You don't have to attend every meeting you're invited to. You will have to decide if your work schedule is more or less important than that meeting.

- Leaving

Do not stay in meetings that are waste of time for you, you must find a way to leave.

- Have an agenda and a goal

The meeting must have a clear agenda, times for each topic and an objective.

-Stand-Up Meetings
They are short meetings in which each participant answers three questions:
1. What I did yesterday?
2. What am I going to do today?
3. What's in my way?

- Iteration planning meetings

They are intended to select the pending elements that will be executed in the next iteration.

- Iteration retrospective and demo

These meetings are held at the end of each iteration. The team members discuss what went right and what went wrong.

- Arguments/disagreements

To avoid prolonged meetings of disagreements, if you want to resolve a disagreement, the best option is for each person to present their case and then have the whole team vote.

**Focus/Mana**

We should not spend all our energy on things that do not give us anything.

- Sleep

It is important to manage it well to be rested when it comes to work.

- Caffeine

Sometimes you can benefit from this, but it is personal how it affects each one.

- Recharge

It is better to take a break and continue working than to make yourself tired as you will not perform as well and you will probably have to do the work again.

- Muscle focus

Physical focus can help unwind and recharge

**Time boxing and tomatoes**

A good way to manage time is the technique called "tomatoes." This technique consists of setting the timer for about 25 minutes and not losing concentration or getting distracted by anything. When those 25 minutes are up take a break for about 5 minutes and then use the timer again.

**Avoidance**

- Priority Inversion

Investment priority is a behavior in which we put things ahead that are less important than others and it is unprofessional behavior.

- Blind Alleys

You have to have an open mind and not focus on an impossible idea.

- Marshes, bogs, swamps, and other messes

Messes are worse than dead ends, as breaking software can be a problem for everyone. You have to avoid the messes at all costs.
