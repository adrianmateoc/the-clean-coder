## ESTIMATION

Companies see estimates as compromises and developers as guesses.

- A commitment

You should not commit if you do not know if you can fulfill it.

- An estimate

When an estimate is made, it is because you do not know when something will be ready.

- Implied commitments

You have to commit only when possible and you have to make estimates that are as correct as possible so that others can organize around that estimate.

**PERT**

There are three estimates to consider based on the PERT evaluation technique:
1. Optimistic estimate: It is an estimate in which everything should go well
2. Nominal estimate: This is the estimate with the highest probability of success.
3. Pessimistic estimate: It is unlikely but things can always go wrong

**Estimating tasks**

- Wideband Delphi: It involves convening a meeting and having a group of people estimate the time required for a task.

- Flying Fingers: It consists of a group of people voting simultaneously showing their fingers to vote for something depending on the fingers that each person shows. Most are wanted.

- Planning Poker: It consists of voting with cards similar to the estimates of each person. It is similar to the previous technique but with cards.

- Affinity Estimation: It consists of distributing the cards of each task depending on how long they will take to complete. Cards moved more than x times are reserved for discussion.

- Trivariate Estimates: This technique is used to decide on a single nominal estimate for each task.

**The law of large numbers**

Estimates are riddled with errors, what can be done to optimize estimates is to break tasks into smaller tasks to make more accurate estimates.
