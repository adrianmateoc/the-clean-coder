## CODING

**PREPARATION**

- First, your code must work
- Your code must solve the problem set for you by the customer
- Your code must fit well into the existing system
- Your code must be readable by other programmers

You shouldn't write code when you're tired, it will not help the code to be in good condition. It's better to be rested to work.

**THE FLOW ZONE**

Sometimes we enter a state of concentration when programming, that is called the zone. Avoid it as it doesn't really help.
If someone interrupts you, it's always good to help, because next time you may be the one to interrupt someone. 

**WRITER'S BLOCK**

If you ever get stuck it's a good idea to find a co-worker

**DEBUGGING**

Debugging is also part of the programming, but we have to reduce it whenever possible. A professional tries his best not to make too many mistakes.

**PACING YOURSELF**

Programming creativity needs breaks, so when you are tired, the best idea is to take a break. Probably many ideas and new ways of dealing with a problem appear during the break.

**BEING LATE**

You'll probably be late at some point, in this case you must present three dates: best case, nominal case, and worst case. And you have to be honest as you can about all three dates.

- OVERTIME: Therefore you should not agree to work overtime unless (1) you can personally afford it, (2) it is short term, two weeks or less, and (3) your boss has a fall-back plan in case the overtime effort fails.
- FALSE DELIVERY: You don't have to deliver a product without it being finished, since it is very easy for something to be finished when it does not work or it is not known if it's working.

**HELP**

- Helping others: Programming is so hard, this is why every programmer should help each other everytime he can. You should be conscious of the status of your teammates and do a solid effort to help them.
- Being helped: You must accept the help and be gracious about it and sometimes if nobody is helping you, you should ask for help. It's unprofessional to remain stuck when you can get help.
- Mentoring: The training of less experienced programmers is the responsibility of those who have more experience. In the same way, these young programmers have the same obligation to seek help from their seniors.
