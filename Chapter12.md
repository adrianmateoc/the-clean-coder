## COLLABORATION

**PROGRAMMERS VERSUS PEOPLE**

There are plenty of programmers who are good at working with people and enjoy the challenge but the group average enjoy the mild sensory deprivation and be "focus" facing a problem.

- Programmers versus employers

You have to be attentive to the needs of the company and be precise or try to be with the hours imposed by the company.

- Programmers versus programmers

  *Owned Code*

  Programmers have to communicate to avoid code duplication, and above all share their code to others.

  *Collective Ownership*

  Professionals don't put property walls around the code, they allow everyone to work on the code.

**CEREBELLUMS**

In the beginning it is better to collaborate with others and share ideas, but there are times when you are doing such simple tasks that it is better to be alone to complete it faster. There are also times when it is convenient to be alone to solve specific problems.
