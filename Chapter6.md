## PRACTICING

To program in an agile and fast way you need practice.

- KATA

One way to practice programming is known as kata. Kata is used to increase your agility by solving simple problems. A programmer has to have several katas to practice and in this way speed up the programming when faced with real problems.

- WASA

This way of practicing consists of one programmer carrying out the code and another carrying out the unit tests. Then they swap roles.

- RANDORI

Randori is another way to practice programming. It consists of a group of people getting together and lining up, the first proposes a problem and the next solves it, and in this way consecutively.

**BROADENING YOUR EXPERIENCE**

Programmers usually suffer from a lack of diversity, as employers tend to categorize them into one language, platform, and domain. And this does not positively affect the programmer.

- Open Source

It is a good way to improve and expand your skills, participating in open source project with other people with a programming language different from yours.

- Practice Ethics

Professional programmers use their own time to practice their skills, employers have nothing to do with it.
