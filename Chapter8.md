**QA should not find anything**

The goal of the developers is to ensure that QA does not find any bugs.

- QA I am part of the team
QA and developers can work together to improve the system.
The main role of quality control will be as a specifier and characteriser.

*QA as specifier*: They create tests based on business requirements so developers can know how the system should behave.

*QA how to characterize*: use the tests to characterize the real behavior of the running system

**The test automation pyramid**

- Unit tests: It is the base of the pyramid, they are tests by programmers for programmers. They are written before you start scheduling a project to stay on target throughout the life of the project. They are used to check the correct operation of the system.
- Component tests: Each component has a business rule, therefore each test is an acceptance test for that business rule
- Integration tests: These tests are especially important in large systems with many components. They are used to view the communication between sets of components.
- System tests: They are used to see if the system construction is correct and run less frequently.
- Manual exploratory tests: The objective of these tests is to see the behavior of the system in the face of human creativity.
