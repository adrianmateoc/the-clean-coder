## MENTORING, APPRENTICESHIP, AND CRAFTSMANSHIP

**DEGREES OF FAILURE**

School or what you study is not necessarily going to prepare you for work. It is one thing to get a degree and another to be prepared for the world of work.
What you learn in school and what you find on the job are often very different things.

**MENTORING**

It is always a good idea to look for a mentor, someone to guide and advise you when you start in a world where you have no knowledge of anything. It is okay to seek the solution yourself, but sometimes it is necessary and better option to look for help from someone who knows.

**APPRENTICESHIP**

Like many things in life, coding requires learning. Once you leave school, it would not be correct to code directly, it would be optimal to continue learning, since one thing is to code at school and quite another to code for a company.

*Software Apprenticeship*

How should someone learn software?

-  Masters: They are programmers with more than 10 years of experience, having worked with many systems, programming languages and operating systems. They know how to coordinate and how to lead.

- Journeymen: They are trained programmers, but without much experience, they are usually around 5 years of experience. They are programmers who tend to know a programming language. Right now they are learning to work as a team and to be good leaders. Journeymen are reviewed by masters or other higher ranking journeymen. Their code is closely reviewed and as they gain more experience their autonomy increases.

- Apprentices/Interns: These are the recent graduates. They have no autonomy and are closely checked by journeymens. At first they simply provide assistance to journeymens. The apprenticeship should last about a year.

***The Reality***

All of this is idealized and hypothetical. The reality is that most companies do not provide technical supervision and that is a problem since it is the most important thing.
