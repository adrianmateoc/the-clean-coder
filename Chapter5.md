## TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

**THE THREE LAWS OF TDD**

- You are not allowed to write any production code until you have first written
a failing unit test.
- You are not allowed to write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail and
not compiling is failing.
- You are not allowed to write more production code that is sufficient to pass
the currently failing unit test.

**THE LITANY OF BENEFITS**

- Certainty: If you use TDD as a professional discipline, you'll write hundreds of tests every week and you'll use them every time you make any change to the code.
- Courage: One of the benefits of using TDD is to be sure that your changes are correct, so you can be relaxed about this changes.
- Documentation: The unit tests are documents, you can learn how to a system is working in his lowest-level design thanks to them.
- Design: To test a function that this one calls other functions is hard and you have to figure out some way to decouple the function from all the others. In other words, it forces you to think about good design.
- The professional option: Since TDD has a lot of benefits, it could be considered unprofessional not to use it.
