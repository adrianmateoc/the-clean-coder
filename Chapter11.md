## PRESSURE

**AVOIDING PRESSURE**

The best way to avoid it is to avoid situations that provoke it

- Commitments

Tt is difficult to deal with an unfulfilled commitment. Whenever we can, we must be careful with what we commit to do

- Staying clean

If you want to go fast and keep deadlines is to have clean code and avoid messes.

- Crisis discipline

Use the disciplines you want to use at a critical moment, as these disciplines are the ones you will be most comfortable with. Above all, do not change your behavior in times of crisis, as this will generate more messes and errors.

**HANDLING PRESSURE**

- Don't panic

In moments of pressure you should not go fast and work for hours as that will not help you. You have to go slowly and think well about the problem in order to find the best result.

- Communicate

Let people who can help you know that you are in trouble so they can help and guide you. Do not let them know unexpectedly that you have a problem, because that will increase the pressure even more.

- Rely on your disciplines

In moments of pressure the best option is to hold on to your disciplines and not abandon them.

- Get help

Try to find a partner who is willing to program with you, that will help you finish faster and with fewer errors. In the same way you have to help others in times of pressure.
