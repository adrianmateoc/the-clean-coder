## TOOLING

**TOOLS**

You don't have to be conversant with all the tools there are a few that every software developer must be.

**SOUCE CODE CONTROL**

the open source tools are usually your best option because they are written by developers, for developers.

- AN "ENTERPRISE" SOURCE CONTROL SYSTEM: If your company is using a "enterprise" source code control system, you can use both. You can check your source code into the “enterprise” system at the end of each
iteration (once every two weeks or so) and use one of the open source systems.
- PESSIMISTIC VERSUS OPTIMISTIC LOCKING: Thanks to new systems, this strategy of locking files is outdated and not very useful.
- CVS / SVN: The old standby source control system is CVS. It was very good at dealing with individual files and directories, but it's not very good renaming files or deleting directories. Subversion, works very nicely, it allows you to check out the whole system in a single operation, and easily update merge and commit. However, it's not very good branching.
- Branching: SVN is a good option, but there are better options like git.
- git: Git is a game changer for developers and should be a must using it.

**IDE/EDITOR**

As developers we read and edit a lot of code. The tools to do it should be good.

- VI: It's an outdated editor but it can be used for little things.
- EMACS: As a
general-purpose editing tool, nothing else even comes close. On the other hand,
I think that Emacs cannot really compete with the specific-purpose IDEs that
now dominate. IntelliJ is a better option.
- ECLIPSE/INTELLIJ: Both are very good options as IDE, Eclipse is similar in power and scope to IntelliJ. However, the learning curve is high, and project
set-up time is not insignificant. These tools are not lightweight. They take a lot of computing resources to run.
- TEXTMATE: Tt's powerful and lightweight. It can't do wonderful manipulations that IntelliJ and Eclipse can do, it's not as fast as VI and doesn't have the powerful lisp engine and library of Emacs but it's easy to use and intuitive.

**ISSUE TRACKING**

- BUG COUNTS

**CONTINUOUS BUILD**

**UNIT TESTING TOOLS**

1. It should be quick and easy to run the tests.
2. The tool should give you a clear visual pass/fail indication.
3. The tool should give you a clear visual indication of progress.
4. The tool should discourage individual test cases from communicating with
each other.
5. The tool should make it very easy to write tests.
